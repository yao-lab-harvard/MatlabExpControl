The software system for the DAx14000 and DAx22000 consists of two things:

1) USB drivers for FTDI chipset (usually installed automatically on Win7).

2) DAx22000 card API  (e.g. dax22000_GUI_32.exe and ftd2xx.dll). 

See DAx22000_Manual.pdf for complete details on software installation, the GUI 
application, and programmers API (DLL).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In general, the USB system drivers should automatically install on Windows 7/8/10 if 
automatic updates is enabled. If not, then you must run the Device Manager and install
them manually by pointing to the "CDM v2.12.26 WHQL Certified" directory.
