GPIB version 2.0


1. Introduction
---------------

Use this README file for building and installing GPIB for 32 bit Windows 
(NT, 95 and 98) operating systems.


2. Compiling GPIB
-----------------

GPIB should compile and run with either MATLAB version 4 or 5.

Files required to build the MEX file ("gpib.dll") are "gpib.c" in the main 
directory, "gpib.h" in this directory, and various files provided by 
National Instruments (which I believe are "gpib-32.obj" and "decl-32.h").  

I have not been able to build the MEX file from MATLAB's command line.
See TMW's instructions for custom building of MEX-files (in section 8 of 
the "MATLAB API Guide").

See ftp://ftp.natinst.com/support/gpib/win98-95/ and 
ftp://ftp.natinst.com/support/gpib/winNT/ for the latest National 
Instruments software and build instructions.


3. NI driver configuration
--------------------------

No configuration changes should be required.


4. Pre-compiled binary
-----------------------

A complied MEX-file for NT 4.0 is included.  If you are running this OS, 
the MEX-file should be ready to use.

It's possible that it will work with Windows 95/98.


5. Installation
---------------

Place both "gpib.dll" and "gpib.m" in a directory that is in MATLAB's 
search path. The MATLAB command 'which gpib' should find the MEX-file and 
'help gpib' should display the help file.
