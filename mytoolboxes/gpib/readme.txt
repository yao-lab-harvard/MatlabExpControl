				GPIB Matlab Toolbox

This toolbox is a wrapper for the GPIB library from National Instrument. It allows calling NI-488 and NI-488.2 routines from Matlab 5.3.
The wrapper gpib53.cpp for the library was generated by the H2MEX program from the header file gpib2.h.

Installation
1) Download the toolbox gpib53.exe
2) Execute gpib53.exe (double click) and choose a destination directory to extract the zip file.
for exemple : c:\mytools\gpib53
3) Run Matlab and add the toolbox directory to your path.
That's all.

Documentation
No help is included in the matlab function that interfaces the GPIB library But the names of the Matab functions in the toolbox is the same as thoses in the NI library.
The toolbox is useless if you don't a GPIB card and GPIB driver installed correctly. If you have the NI GPIB driver instaled then look at gpib.hlp (windows help file) to see the documentation about the use of the functions in the toolbox.

_______________________________________________________________________
BUILDING 
If you want to compile the DLL yourself do the following from matlab
>>mex -v gpib53.cpp gpib-32.obj
where gpib-32.obj the the adequate NI driver for your compiler.
